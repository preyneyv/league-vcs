**NOTE:** Currently in beta, prone to spontaneous combustion. Do not use for any production-level projects. It *should*
work but that doesn't mean it *will*.

### Features

- Easy-to-use replay watching from any previous League of Legends patch.
  - Detects the patch version from the `.rofl` file. 
- Automatic store backups of old League of Legends versions.
  - Only stores the changed files to make better use of limited storage.

### Supported Platforms
League VCS only supports 64-bit Windows, and I don't have any plans to add 32-bit Windows or macOS support.

Only Windows 10 has been tested, but it _should_ work with Windows 7/8 too.

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/preyneyv/league-vcs/wiki) for setup and usage instructions.
